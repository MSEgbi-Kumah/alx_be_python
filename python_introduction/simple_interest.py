# Variables for Simple Interst Formula
principal = 1000
rate = 0.05
time = 3

# Making Sure Variables are intergers
interest = principal * rate * time
principal = int(1000.0)
rate = int(0.050)
time = int(3.0)

#Performing Calculations and printing their results
print("The simple interest is:", interest)
